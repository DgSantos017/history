# the brunette pen
On a certain day in the month of june 2019, i was sleeping peacefully in my room counting sheep when i opened my eyes there was a woman standing in front of me, with a butter stained book, blue hair and black clothes, it looked like a pen, i was looking at her I felt like laughing and moved away from the bed to the side of the wall, I felt the bed sink next to me and fuck it I tried to go back to sleep the same way. the slut continued by my side, I asked to be quiet because I was sleepy and I had a college exam early in the morning, I didn't want this slut disturbing my life. I sang a song by Racionais-MCS until I could sleep and I remember this woman's face to this day. the next day, sleepy, I got 3 in college and waited for her to punch her in the mouth, I was very angry, but she never came back and I had no one to take out my hate on
